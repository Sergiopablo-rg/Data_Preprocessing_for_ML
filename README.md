Depy 2016 Talk: Pre-Modeling: Data Preprocessing and Feature Exploration in Python

Author: April Chen, Data Scientist at Civis Analytics

This is an introduction to data preprocessing and feature exploration that are crucial steps in a modeling workflow. In this tutorial, April Chen will demonstrate how to use Python libraries such as scikit-learn, statsmodels, and matplotlib to perform pre-modeling steps. Topics that will be covered include: missing values, variable types, outlier detection, multicollinearity, interaction terms, and visualizing variable distributions. Finally, she will show the impact of utilizing these techniques on model performance.
